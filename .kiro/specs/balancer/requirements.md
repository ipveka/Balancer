# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Balancer project is a modular SaaS platform designed for supply chain optimization. It provides a comprehensive backend solution built with FastAPI that enables businesses to manage and optimize their supply chain operations across four key domains: supply management, inventory tracking, demand forecasting, and distribution planning. The platform follows a microservices-inspired modular architecture where each domain operates independently while sharing common utilities and data models.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a supply chain manager, I want a modular backend platform with separate domains for supply, inventory, demand, and distribution, so that I can manage different aspects of my supply chain independently while maintaining system cohesion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is initialized THEN it SHALL expose four separate API modules: supply, inventory, demand, and distribution
2. WHEN a module is accessed THEN it SHALL operate independently without requiring other modules to be functional
3. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL include all module routers in the main FastAPI application
4. IF a module fails THEN other modules SHALL continue to operate normally

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured project with clear separation of concerns, so that I can easily maintain, extend, and test the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the project structure THEN each module SHALL contain api.py, models.py, service.py, and example.py files
2. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN it SHALL follow PEP8 standards and include comprehensive docstrings
3. WHEN accessing shared functionality THEN it SHALL be available through a centralized utils directory
4. WHEN running tests THEN they SHALL be organized in a centralized tests directory with separate test files for each module

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want RESTful endpoints for each supply chain domain, so that I can integrate with the platform programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests THEN each module SHALL expose CRUD operations through FastAPI routes
2. WHEN sending data to endpoints THEN all input SHALL be validated using Pydantic models
3. WHEN receiving responses THEN all output SHALL conform to defined Pydantic schemas
4. WHEN accessing API documentation THEN it SHALL be automatically generated and accessible via FastAPI's built-in docs

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable AI model parameters and environment management, so that I can tune the platform's machine learning capabilities across different deployment scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL load configuration from environment variables including AI model parameters
2. WHEN configuring AI features THEN it SHALL support forecast frequency (default: weekly), service levels (default: 95%), lead times, and transport capacity limits
3. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN ML model parameters SHALL be easily adjustable without code changes
4. WHEN tuning performance THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of model training parameters and optimization settings
5. IF required AI configuration parameters are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with defaults

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage with dummy data, so that I can verify functionality without external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN each module SHALL have corresponding pytest test files
2. WHEN tests execute THEN they SHALL use mock data generated by utils/dummy_data.py
3. WHEN testing API endpoints THEN they SHALL verify both successful and error scenarios
4. WHEN testing business logic THEN service layer functions SHALL be tested independently of API routes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a supply chain analyst, I want intelligent procurement and manufacturing planning that processes input data and generates optimized quantity recommendations, so that I can make data-driven supply decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN operating in procurement mode THEN the system SHALL accept CSV files with columns: sku, current_inventory, forecast_demand_4weeks, safety_stock, min_order_qty, supplier_id, unit_cost
2. WHEN operating in manufacturing mode THEN the system SHALL accept CSV files with columns: sku, current_inventory, forecast_demand_4weeks, safety_stock, batch_size, production_time_days, unit_cost
3. WHEN generating procurement recommendations THEN the system SHALL produce CSV files with columns: sku, recommended_quantity, supplier_id, order_date, expected_delivery, total_cost
4. WHEN generating manufacturing recommendations THEN the system SHALL produce CSV files with columns: sku, recommended_batch_qty, production_start_date, production_complete_date, total_cost
5. WHEN optimizing quantities THEN the system SHALL consider current inventory, forecasted demand, safety stock requirements, and minimum order constraints

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an inventory manager, I want intelligent inventory management that processes current stock data and generates actionable recommendations, so that I can maintain optimal inventory levels and prevent stockouts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading inventory data THEN the system SHALL accept CSV files with columns: sku, current_stock, lead_time_days, service_level_target, avg_weekly_demand, demand_std_dev
2. WHEN calculating safety stock THEN the system SHALL use demand variability, lead time, and configurable service level from input data
3. WHEN generating recommendations THEN the system SHALL produce CSV files with columns: sku, safety_stock, reorder_point, current_stock, recommended_action, days_until_stockout
4. WHEN determining actions THEN the system SHALL provide specific recommendations like "REORDER", "URGENT_REORDER", or "SUFFICIENT_STOCK"
5. WHEN calculating stockout risk THEN the system SHALL predict days until stockout based on current stock and demand patterns

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a demand planner, I want AI-powered demand forecasting that processes CSV input data and generates accurate predictions, so that I can plan inventory and procurement based on reliable forecasts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading demand data THEN the system SHALL accept CSV files with columns: date, sku, quantity
2. WHEN processing forecasts THEN the system SHALL use LightGBM machine learning pipeline for time-series prediction
3. WHEN generating output THEN the system SHALL produce CSV files with columns: sku, forecast_date, prediction
4. WHEN training models THEN the system SHALL include lagged demand, moving averages, seasonality indicators, and time-based features
5. WHEN evaluating predictions THEN the system SHALL provide forecast accuracy metrics and model performance indicators

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a logistics coordinator, I want AI-powered distribution optimization that processes order and vehicle data to generate optimal route assignments, so that I can minimize delivery costs and maximize vehicle utilization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading order data THEN the system SHALL accept CSV files with columns: order_id, customer_lat, customer_lon, volume_m3, weight_kg
2. WHEN uploading vehicle data THEN the system SHALL accept CSV files with columns: vehicle_id, max_volume_m3, max_weight_kg, cost_per_km
3. WHEN generating route assignments THEN the system SHALL produce CSV files with columns: vehicle_id, order_id, sequence, distance_km, total_cost
4. WHEN optimizing routes THEN the system SHALL use VRP heuristic algorithms (greedy/nearest neighbor) to minimize total distance and cost
5. WHEN assigning orders THEN the system SHALL respect vehicle capacity constraints for both volume and weight limits

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want example implementations and documentation, so that I can understand how to use and extend the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exploring modules THEN each SHALL include an example.py file demonstrating usage
